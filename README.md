This was a practice to build a DL model for real-world data during the QBS (Quantitative Business Science) course in college. 

The journey included navigating through complex data structures, optimizing hyperparameters, and implementing advanced techniques, enriched my understanding of deep learning, and utilize it to tackle the complexities of data challenges.
